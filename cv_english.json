I have experience working with different technologies and frameworks, which allows me to learn and adapt quickly to new environments.\n\nCurrently, I'm focused on mobile development with React Native, but I also have a strong background in backend development, working with NestJS, Express, and FastAPI, as well as databases like PostgreSQL and Docker environments. I don’t limit myself to a single stack — I enjoy understanding how the entire ecosystem works and choosing the best tools for each project.",
